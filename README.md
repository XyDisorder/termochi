# termochi 🌸

**A cozy terminal tamagotchi you install with npm.**

Adopt a companion, name them, choose their personality — and care for them directly from your shell.
They live in your terminal. They remember you. They have feelings.

## What is this?

Termochi is a **virtual pet that lives in your terminal**. It's not a toy demo — it's a fully-featured companion with real mechanics:

- Stats that degrade over time (based on how long you're away)
- Actions with cooldowns — you can't just spam feed
- A **playable mini-game** when you want to play or feed
- **Mood-reactive avatars** — your pet's face changes when they're sick, hungry, grumpy, or euphoric
- **Random events** that happen while you're gone (nightmares, found snacks, made friends...)
- **Shell prompt integration** and a **tmux watch mode** so your pet is always visible
- **AI companion chat** — talk to your companion powered by Claude or OpenAI
- **GitHub & Linear integration** — your work tasks and PR load affect your companion's mood
- **Evolution stages** — your companion grows over time as you spend days together

## Install

```bash
npm install -g termochi
termochi
```

First launch starts the onboarding. Just follow along.

---

## Companions

Pick one of 4 species — each with a **visual preview and distinct personality**:

```
[1] Blob                        [2] Neko
    ╭─────╮                      /\_/\
   │ ◕ ‿ ◕ │                   ( o.o )
    ╰──┬──╯                     > ^ <
       ╰╯
Round, squishy, and hungry.    Curious cat. Needs attention.
Forgiving. Loves eating.       High energy. Very playful.

[3] Bot                         [4] Sprout
 ┌──────┐                          \|/
 │ ◉  ◉ │                       ──╼*╾──
 │  ──  │                          /|\
 └──┬───┘                          ╰╯
Calm and disciplined.          Gentle digital seedling.
Stable stats, stays tidy.      Loves rest and cleanliness.
```

---

## Game Modes

Chosen during onboarding. Each mode shows a **concrete example** of what changes:

| Mode | Degradation | After 8h away |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| 🍵 **Cozy** | 0.5× | Mild hunger, mood slightly down — very forgiving |
| ⚖️ **Normal** | 1× | Notable hunger, low energy, needs attention |
| 💀 **Hardcore** | 2× | Very hungry, poor mood, messy space |

---

## Themes

5 visual themes, configurable at any time with `termochi config`:

| Theme | Vibe |
|-------|------|
| 🌸 **Pastel** | Soft pinks and lavender |
| 💚 **Terminal Green** | Classic hacker green |
| ⚡ **Cyber Neon** | Cyan and magenta |
| 🌅 **Sunset** | Warm orange and gold |
| ◻ **Mono** | Clean white on black |

---

## Evolution Stages

Your companion evolves as you spend time together. Their badge updates in the header.

| Stage | Badge | Unlocks at |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Egg | 🥚 | Day 0 |
| Baby | 🐣 | Day 1 |
| Young | 🌱 | Day 7 |
| Adult | ✦ | Day 30 |
| Veteran | ★ | Day 90 |

The Stats screen shows the current stage, days alive, and days until next evolution.

---

## Actions

All actions have **cooldowns** and **stat gates** — no infinite feeding.

| Key | Action | Cooldown | Blocked when |
|-----|--------|----------|--------------|
| `f` | Feed | 45 min | Hunger ≥ 88% ("already full") |
| `p` | Play | 30 min | Energy ≤ 15% ("too tired") |
| `s` | Sleep | 2 hours | Energy ≥ 88% ("not tired yet") |
| `c` | Clean | 90 min | Cleanliness ≥ 88% ("already clean") |
| `h` | Heal | 3 hours | Health ≥ 88% ("already healthy") |

---

## 🎮 Mini-game: Catch the Treats

When you press `p` to play (and your pet has energy), a real mini-game launches:

```
╭─── 🎮 Catch the treats! ──────── ✦ 4  ⏱ 12s ╮
│                                               │
│ │          ✦                                │ │
│ │    ✦                    ✦                 │ │
│ │                  ✦                        │ │
│ │                                           │ │
│ │        ✦                    ✦             │ │
│ │                                           │ │
│ │                   ╰─◉─╯                  │ │
│                ← → or A D to move            │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

- Treats fall from the top at random columns
- Move your pet with `←` `→` or `A` `D`
- 20 seconds, catch as many as you can
- **Your score directly affects the mood bonus** — a perfect run gives a huge happiness boost

---

## 💬 AI Companion Chat

Press `a` to open a chat with your companion, powered by Claude or OpenAI.

Your companion **never breaks character** — they respond as themselves, with full awareness of their current mood, species, and stats. But they're also genuinely helpful: ask for code help, ideas, or just have a conversation.

```
╭─── Chat with Mochi ──────────────────────────────╮
│                                                   │
│  Mochi  Heyyyy! I'm feeling pretty good today ~  │
│         My hunger's at 82% but I'm managing :3   │
│                                                   │
│  You   can you help me write a git commit message │
│                                                   │
│  Mochi  Sure! What did you change? Tell me and   │
│         I'll write something good for you ✦      │
│                                                   │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
  > _
  /remember …   /forget   esc back
```

### Persistent Memory

Your companion remembers things across sessions:

```
/remember I prefer TypeScript over Python
/remember my project is called termochi
/forget        ← clears all memories
```

Memories are injected into every conversation — your companion won't ask the same questions twice.

Talking to your companion applies the Talk action, boosting mood.

### Setup

Go to Settings (`,`) → configure your AI provider and API key.
Supported: **Claude** (Anthropic) and **OpenAI** (GPT-4o and friends).

╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
  ↑↓ navigate   ↵ open in browser   1/2/tab switch   esc back
```

- `↑` `↓` to navigate, `↵` to open in browser
- `1` / `2` / `tab` to switch between GitHub and Linear
- PRs open for more than 2 days are flagged with `⚠` and a red border
- Reviews requested are shown with `⊙`

### Mood impact

Your companion reacts to your workload:

- 5+ PRs awaiting your review, or urgent Linear issues → mood malus applied

### GitHub widget on main screen

Press `g` on the main screen to toggle a compact GitHub summary:

```
GH  ✓ 3 merged  ● 5 open  ⊙ 2 review  ⚠ 1 stuck
```

Visibility preference is saved automatically.

### Setup

Go to Settings (`,`) and enter:
- **GitHub token** — personal access token with `repo` + `read:user` scope
- **Linear API key** — from your Linear settings → API

API keys are stored locally at `~/.termochi/integrations.json` (same approach as `gh`, `aws`, `npm`).

---

## Mood-Reactive Faces

Your companion's face changes based on their current mood:

```
euphoric    happy/calm   tired        hungry       sick
✨╭────╮✨   ╭────╮      ╭────╮      ╭────╮      ╭────╮
 │◕ ω ◕│    │◕ ‿ ◕│     │≧ _ ≦│     │◕ ᗙ ◕│     │× ᵕ ×│
  ╰──┬──╯    ╰──┬──╯     ╰──┬──╯     ╰──┬──╯     ╰──┬──╯
```

Critical stat bars pulse red. Stat bars **animate smoothly** when they change.

---

## Random Events

Things happen while you're away. When you open termochi after a long absence, a notification may appear:

```
✨ Made a new friend! — Met someone interesting in the digital world!
☔ Cozy rainy day — Stayed indoors and watched the rain. Very cozy.
😰 Nightmare... — Tossed and turned all night. Not a great sleep.
🍪 Found a snack! — Your companion discovered a hidden treat while you were away.
```

Probability scales with absence time. Rare for short sessions, common after long breaks.

---

## Pin it to your shell

### Shell prompt

Add your companion's status to your terminal prompt:

```bash
# ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
termochi_prompt() { termochi prompt 2>/dev/null; }
PROMPT='$(termochi_prompt) → '
```

Output: `🫧 Mochi 😊 →`
With a critical stat: `🐱 Pip 😾 ! →`

**Starship** (`~/.config/starship.toml`):
```toml
[custom.termochi]
command = "termochi prompt --compact"
when = "termochi doctor 2>/dev/null"
format = "[$output]($style) "
style = "bold"
```

### tmux side pane

Run `termochi watch` in a small persistent pane. It auto-refreshes every 5 minutes:

```
╭─ Mochi · Blob ────────────╮
│ Mochi is feeling good.     │
│ 🍖 ████████░░  80%        │
│ ⚡ ██████░░░░  60%        │
│ 💭 █████████░  91%        │
│ ✨ ████████░░  80%        │
│ ❤️ ██████████ 100%        │
│ cozy              22:09   │
│ [r] refresh  [q] quit     │
╰────────────────────────────╯
```

```bash
termochi watch             # refresh every 5 min (default)
termochi watch --interval 2  # refresh every 2 min
```

---

## All Commands

```bash
termochi              # Open interactive UI (or start onboarding)
termochi feed         # Feed your companion
termochi play         # Launch the mini-game
termochi sleep        # Put them to sleep
termochi clean        # Clean their space
termochi stats        # Detailed stats view
termochi config       # Change theme
termochi rename <n>   # Rename your companion
termochi reset        # Start over (with confirmation)
termochi doctor       # Check local config & state
termochi prompt       # One-line status for shell prompt
termochi prompt --compact   # Extra-short for tmux statusline
termochi watch        # Live compact view for tmux pane
termochi watch --interval 2  # Custom refresh interval (minutes)
termochi commit       # AI-generated summary of today's git commits
termochi notify-prs   # Send a desktop notification if any PRs are stuck (>48h)
```

### `termochi commit`

Summarizes today's git commits using your AI companion:

```bash
termochi commit
# → Mochi: You fixed the auth flow and added dark mode today —
#          solid progress! The race condition fix especially 🌟
```

Useful as a daily standup helper or end-of-day recap. Requires AI configured in Settings.

### `termochi notify-prs`

Checks GitHub for open PRs with no activity for 48+ hours and sends a macOS desktop notification. Silent if nothing is stuck. Designed to run as a cron job:

```bash
# ~/Library/LaunchAgents or crontab
0 9 * * * termochi notify-prs
```

---

## How time works

Termochi uses **real elapsed time** — not sessions. Close your terminal, come back tomorrow: your companion's stats will have degraded based on exactly how many hours passed, scaled by your game mode.

- Stats degrade per hour: hunger, energy, mood, cleanliness, health
- Stats also degrade live every 30 seconds while the app is open
- Critical stats (< 20%) cause extra health damage over time
- Critical stat bars **pulse red** and trigger a beep sound
- Long absences may trigger a random event on your next login
- No permadeath — your companion gets sad and neglected, but never disappears

State is stored locally at `~/.termochi/state.json`.

---

## Local storage

All data lives in `~/.termochi/`:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `state.json` | Pet state (stats, name, species, timestamps) |
| `ai-config.json` | AI provider + API key |
| `integrations.json` | GitHub token, Linear key, widget preferences |
| `memory.json` | Companion memories from `/remember` |

---

## Development

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd termochi
npm install
npm run dev       # Run directly with tsx (no build step)
npm run build     # Compile TypeScript → dist/
npm test          # Run unit tests
npm run lint      # ESLint
npm run format    # Prettier
```
